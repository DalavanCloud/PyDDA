This is an example on how to use SciPy's optimize package to integrate measurements from multiple radars to create a 3D wind field. 
The user has an option to adjust strength of data, mass continuity constraints.

This code is currently incredibly barebones and still a work in progress.

The code here is based off of Potvin et al. (2012) and Shapiro et al. (2009).
